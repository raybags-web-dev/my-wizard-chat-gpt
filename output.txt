Chat GTP (or Generalized Text Parser) is a web-based natural language processing tool developed by MeaningCloud that allows users to quickly and easily extract structured information from text. It is used to automatically detect and label entities in text, identify their type, and return the data in a ready-to-use format. The tool can be used to extract entities such as named entities, dates and times, locations, money and financial amounts, organizations and people, products, keywords, and more.

1. Continue to learn and grow your skillset. Keeping up with the constant changes in technology is key. Take time to research new technologies and explore areas of interest.

2. Work on different projects to build your experience and gain exposure to various technologies.

3. Network and connect with other developers, attend conferences and hackathons, or even take part in open source projects.

4. Mentor junior developers and build a network of contacts.

5. Demonstrate your ability to think through complex problems and show off your problem-solving abilities.

6. Take on increasingly complex tasks and challenge yourself.

7. Be proactive and reach out to more senior developers for advice and guidance.

# Cross-Validation 

Cross validation is a method of splitting your data into t parts, and using one part to fit the model & other parts to test the model.

You may split you data into 2 or 3 parts, but k- Fold Cross Validation is the most commonly used.

K-Fold Cross-Validation:
1. Divide the dataset in k-parts
2. Choose one part which is called the validation set, this will be used to calculate the accuracy of the model
3. The remaining k-1 parts will be used to train the model
4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 for all k-parts until all the parts are used for validation and training
5. Once all the parts have been used for validation and training, take an average of the accuracies calculated in all the iterations.

Using cross-validation helps us reduce the bias which usually arises when evaluating the performance of a model which is trained on a single dataset.
